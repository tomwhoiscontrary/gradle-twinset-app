This project demonstrates one of the innumerable headaches of using generated code in Gradle.

The application has a main class in the main source set which dynamically loads a class from a generated source set. I don't think it actually matters that the other source set is generated; what's important is that it's a separate source set. The class in the generated source set has compile-time dependencies on both the main source set, and a module dependency. The main source set also has module dependencies. Got that?

For this to work, Gradle has to set up compile classpaths like this:

main:: main module dependencies
generated:: generated module dependencies, main output

And runtime classpaths like this:

main:: main module dependencies, main output, generated module dependencies, generated output
generated:: _N/A_

Sadly, i haven't worked out how to do this.

Ideally, it should be possible to do:

  ./gradlew run

And even:

  ./gradlew installDist
  build/install/gradle-twinset-app/bin/gradle-twinset-app

But those don't work. The neither the output nor the module dependencies of the generated source set makes it onto the run classpath, or into the distribution.

Bafflingly, a simple run task defined in the build script works fine:

  ./gradlew runProperly
